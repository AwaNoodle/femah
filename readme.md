##Femah##
Femah is a feature switching/toggling library, requiring minimal configuration.  Designed from day 1 to be enterprise scalable, our intention is to provide a robust and extensible framework to enable the .NET community to embrace the stable mainline (trunk) method of development and realise Continuous Delivery.

MVP Goals:
1. Provide common feature switch types for majority of typical scenarios out of the box
1. Provide ability to extend with custom feature switch types
1. Provide a UI for controlling feature state
1. Provide a full API for automation
1. Completely failsafe - host app stability is never compromised

Femah enables:

1. A/B style testing and canary releases
1. Feature state testing in the build/deployment pipeline via the API
