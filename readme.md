##Femah##
Femah is a feature switching/toggling library, requiring minimal configuration.  Designed from day 1 to be enterprise scalable, our intention is to provide a robust and extensible framework to enable the .NET community to embrace the stable mainline (trunk) method of development and realise Continuous Delivery.

##### MVP Goals
* Provide common feature switch types for majority of typical scenarios out of the box
* Provide ability to extend with custom feature switch types
* Provide a UI for controlling feature state
* Provide a full API for automation
* Completely failsafe - host app stability is never compromised

##### Femah enables
* A/B style testing and canary releases
* Feature state testing in the build/deployment pipeline via the API
